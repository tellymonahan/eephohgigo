I'm trying to get my Netgear WN121T USB adapter working in 64-bit Ubuntu 10.04 (Lucid Lynx), I have drivers for it that work on my 64-bit installation of Windows 7. I've been trying to use these drivers with ndiswrapper. I used ndisgtk to install the driver. But so far, I haven't had much luck. Ndiswrapper -l shows : ashark@ashark-desktop:~/Downloads$ sudo ndiswrapper -l WARNING: All config files need conf: /etc/modprobe.d/ndiswrapper, it will be ignored in a future release. I've been using the TP-Link Archer T8E for a while. It's a great adapter for Windows but for Linux, it really sucks, at least for me. Firstly, it's not supported by the open-source drivers, only with Broadcom's proprietary drivers, and it appears they never work well, if at all. I've grown quickly frustrated at its constant disconnecting, and sometimes it never recovers without restarting the entire operating system. It appears to be exclusively a Linux problem, since Windows has no problem. Specs: Windows 10 Professional 1809 EasyBox 904 xDSL from Vodafone TP-Link TL-WM823N wireless USB adapter I'm currently between contracts and am using my neighbors wifi, so I can't use Ethernet. My neighbor doesn't have any issues. All other devices (TV, Tablet, Smartphones) work fine with the EasyBox 904X DSL. Using my smarthphone as a hotspot, my PC has no issues receiving internet, but that's not a solution due to the mobile data cap. The wireless adapter and the router are connect.  I bought a wireless adapter for my computer and since day one I have been having this issue, I'm connected to the internet then it goes off and I have to fix the connection so it comes back up, sometimes I boot my computer and it doesn't happen until the next day when I boot again. Every time I fix the issue the windows troubleshooter reports "the default gateway is not available: fixed" but in the next 2 minutes, I would encounter the same scenario. Things I tried: Reinstalling the driver. Edit: Got it to work, the driver was indeed the problem. After installing it, the computer had to reboot. I made the module load after booting automatically and voila. Thank you all! Hi everyone, I bought a cheap laptop from a random brand (Hometech - Alfa 400c) that came with Windows 10 but I can't get the Wifi to work when dual booting with Xubuntu. The taskbar shows a wifi button (which allows me to activate/deactivate the network card) but the list of available network is empty. Beyond. 
So the last PC in my house with windows finally gave me a bsod then locked in a boot loop I couldn't fix so I put mint 19 cinnamon on it but my belkin USB wifi adapter will only work for about 5 minutes then stalls out and I have to unplug and replug the adapter for it to reconnect to my router so I was going to buy a new adapter because the age of my belkin I am presuming to be the main problem(it didn't seem to be performing at 100% on the PC when it had windows) however when I go looking. I've been in contact with Dell in order to get a solution to my 1/3 speed drops under Wireless-N every time I connect a Bluetooth device, be it an MX Anywhere 2 Logitech Mouse, a game controller or an Android phone. This is my experience so far: Made a ticket using SupportAssist day 21  Ticket is still Unassigned as off today Contacted local Dell Support Number day 27 about the delay, which said I would have to contact the assigned support assistant person by email, because. For the last few years I've used a USB Network Adapter to get wifi to my PC. About a week ago, after setting my PC up after it was in storage for a couple of months, I started running into issues where my internet connection will randomly cut out, whilst still having full bars of wifi. When I "diagnose this connection" the problem detected is "The default gateway is not available", however the diagnosis tool says this is "fixed". The internet then works for a very short time, however the problem. Hello everyone. Recently I've upgraded my internet connection from ADSL to VDSL2 and I now have 100 mbps in download and 20 mbps in upload . The problem, though, is that my wifi adapter doesn't seem to be able to make use of the full speed that I now have available for some reason. My wifi adapter is the TP Link wn822n V4 . This adapter says in the official website and on the box that it's capable of running at 300mbps but, for some reason, even directly next to the modem When do "ping www.google.com -t" in Command Prompt i get this: Reply from 172.217.20.4: bytes=32 time=14ms TTL=55 Reply from 172.217.20.4: bytes=32 time=15ms TTL=55 Reply from 172.217.20.4: bytes=32 time=15ms TTL=55 Reply from 172.217.20.4: bytes=32 time=2804ms TTL=55 Reply from 172.217.20.4: bytes=32 time=14ms TTL=55 Reply from 172.217.20.4: bytes=32 time=15ms TTL=55 Reply from 172.217.20.4: bytes=32 time=14ms TTL=55 Reply from 172.217.20.4: bytes=32 time=15ms TTL=55. I’ll give the information I have currently and anyone willing to help is a savior to a geek who sucks at networking commands. To Preface I’ve built many a high performance desktops, and know the basics of networking but everytime I’ve tried my hand at assisting others or handling my own issues, things magically go wrong, but I’ll get to the issue at hand: Windows 10 Yoga 13” 20175 model from 2011. Running Intel i5 3317U with 8GB of RAM, and a Realtek RTL8723AU Wireless 802.11n USB2.0(PCI) netwo. So I recently bought an MSI Intel 8265 PCI-E Wifi adapter so I could get better download speeds (Was using some old D-Link 802.11n adapter). I've installed it correctly but I won't get anywhere above 2.7 megabytes/sec download where it can easily handle up to 112 megabytes. I'm not sure if this is a faulty unit or if this is just how fast the Intel 8265 card can handle and I've wasted my money. Also on the old Wifi card i was surpassing 6 megabytes/sec download. I've already uninstalled # Solved! My problem was that I'm using a hidden SSID for my wireless network. I found that I had to add `scan_ssid=1` to my `/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf` file in order for it to find my router. ---- # Original post, for hysterical reference I'm an experienced linux user, so I figured the Raspberry Pi would be an easy learn for me, and yet here I am. I'm sure this is a PEBKAC problem, because I've followed a few guides now and still can't get any love. When I start my headless. 
Hello, A few days ago I started noticing huge lag spikes whenever I would play games. I realised this problem was caused by my ping moving up into the 1000s at random intervals. The ping spikes are becoming more common, now to the point where every online game I have tested is completely unplayable and I'm kicked in no time. I believe this is due to massive spikes in default gateway pings whenever an online game is launched. Normally it sits at about 2ms but when I load up a game it stays const.
